What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It took me a while to understand what exactly the assignment was asking me to do but once I figure that out I was able to get most of the computer class done without issue. I had trouble choosing where to put update price and update os but once I commited to having the computer class handle everything it was easier to understand.
